# Week 1 fail log
Starting out was difficult. I struggled to use Hypothesis. Initially i was attempting to use Safari, as this is my default browser, but was unable to have hypothesis work. I watched some help videos but ultimately was unable to use it. I decided to download Chrome and switch browsers and it worked instantly. However, besides the first reading, I was unable to make more annotations and I wasn't sure why i was unable to highlight and annotate in the same way.

## First Annotation
My [first annotation] https://hyp.is/HLDu7FfAEeixbFOHyy9JVA/www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=595 was about my genral intwrest in the course and the idea of continuing research much like a detective. I've alwasy been fascinated at the amount of research historians do and how through these small tidbits of information they are able to piece together an entire story.

## Second Annotation
My [second annotation] https://hyp.is/0E_9anWZEem5Io_0e7oSuQ/www.themacroscope.org/?page_id=595 Made me realize that these concepts may be ones i am familiar with. Amoung all the new tech, at it's core I will be exploring themes that I have in the past but it may be presented in a more straightforward and easier to undertand format. The main challenges I'll face in the course may be technical.

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation] https://hyp.is/Ml5q-mUgEee8K3fKeoUNrA/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/rubric-and-assessment.html is a reply that I found extremely helpful as I was expierencing similar issues and found that their solution worked great. This really taught me to make sure when I encounter an isssue that if I first look at what my classmates ahve done, they may have a solution already. 

## Comments/Concerns

I'm very excited to learn more throughout the course as it seems I will be learning valuable skills I can apply to future projects and courses. This course seems to give the rare opportunity to experiment and continue to fail, which is quite the contrast to many other courses! Overall it's exciting to be trying something so new!
